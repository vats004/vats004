👋 Hi, I’m @vats004
👀 I’m interested in pushing chaos to open-source and writing code that somehow works... most of the time.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my code less buggy and more coffee-powered.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some open-source projects that involve a lot of debugging and late-night coding sessions.
📫 How to reach me: You can find me hiding behind a stack of coffee mugs in my hostel. Just DM me on my insta id: @vatsalkeshav
😄 Pronouns: <codeknight num=1> </ codeknight> (unless my code has a bug, then it’s "It/That Thing")
⚡ Fun fact: I once turned a “Hello World” into a full-stack app... by accident.
